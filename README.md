# Air Pollution Awareness Website

## Overview

This project is a replica of the Air Pollution Awareness Website. It includes information about causes, effects, and solutions to air pollution, as well as an Air Quality Index (AQI) checker.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. For the AQI checker to work, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `script.js` with your API key from [AQICN API](https://aqicn.org/api/).

## Features

- Dynamically rendered content from `data.json`.
- AQI checker using the AQICN API.
- Responsive design and optimized code.

## Mock Implementation

If the API key is not available, you can mock the AQI data by returning a hardcoded value in the API call function.
